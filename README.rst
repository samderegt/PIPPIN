======

**PIPPIN** (**P**\D\ **I**\  **p**\i\ **p**\el\ **i**\ne for **N**\ACO data) is a pipeline capable of reducing the polarimetric observations made by the VLT/NACO instrument. It applies the Polarimetric Differential Imaging (PDI) technique to separate the polarised, scattered light from the (largely) un-polarised, stellar light. As a result, circumstellar dust can be uncovered.

A comprehensive archive of the PIPPIN-reduced NACO data products can be found on `Zenodo <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8348803>`_. There, we have published our reductions of potential young systems observed with NACO's polarimetric configuration **paper-citation**. 

If you use PIPPIN or PIPPIN-reduced data products from the archive for your publication, please **cite our paper**.
